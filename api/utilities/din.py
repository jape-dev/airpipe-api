A: Let's think step by step. "Find the title, credit, and department name of courses that have more than one prerequisites?" can be solved by knowing the answer to the following sub-question "What is the title, credit value, and department name for courses with more than one prerequisite?".
The SQL query for the sub-question "What is the title, credit value, and department name for courses with more than one prerequisite?" is SELECT T1.title ,  T1.credits , T1.dept_name FROM course AS T1 JOIN prereq AS T2 ON T1.course_id  =  T2.course_id GROUP BY T2.course_id HAVING count(*)  >  1
So, the answer to the question "Find the name and building of the department with the highest budget." is =
Intermediate_representation: select course.title , course.credits , course.dept_name from course  where  count ( prereq.* )  > 1  group by prereq.course_id 
SQL: SELECT T1.title ,  T1.credits , T1.dept_name FROM course AS T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN prereq AS T2 ON T1.course_id  =  T2.course_id GROUP BY T2.course_id HAVING count(*)  >  1

The SQL query for the sub-question "What is the average budget of departments?" is SELECT avg(budget) FROM department
So, the answer to the question "Give the name and building of the departments with greater than average budget." is =
Intermediate_representation: select department.dept_name , department.building from department  where  @.@ > avg ( department.budget )
SQL: SELECT dept_name ,  building FROM department WHERE budget  >  (SELECT avg(budget) FROM department)

Intermediate_representation: select teaches.ID from teaches  where  teaches.semester = \"Fall\"  and  teaches.year = 2009  and  teaches.semester != \"Spring\"  and  teaches.year = 2010 
SQL: SELECT id FROM teaches WHERE semester  =  'Fall' AND YEAR  =  2009 EXCEPT SELECT id FROM teaches WHERE semester  =  'Spring' AND YEAR  =  2010

Q: "Find the name of the courses that do not have any prerequisite?"
Schema_links: [course.title,course.course_id]
A: Let's think step by step. "Find the name of the courses that do not have any prerequisite?" can be solved by knowing the answer to the following sub-question "What are the courses that have any prerequisite?".
The SQL query for the sub-question "What are the courses that have any prerequisite?" is SELECT course_id FROM prereq
So, the answer to the question "Find the name of the courses that do not have any prerequisite?" is =
Intermediate_representation: select course.title from course  where  @.@ not in prereq.course_id 
SQL: SELECT title FROM course WHERE course_id NOT IN (SELECT course_id FROM prereq)

Q: "Find the salaries of all distinct instructors that are less than the largest salary."
Schema_links: [instructor.salary]
A: Let's think step by step. "Find the salaries of all distinct instructors that are less than the largest salary." can be solved by knowing the answer to the following sub-question "What is the largest salary of instructors".
The SQL query for the sub-question "What is the largest salary of instructors" is SELECT max(salary) FROM instructor
So, the answer to the question "Find the salaries of all distinct instructors that are less than the largest salary." is =
Intermediate_representation: select  distinct instructor.salary from instructor  where  @.@ < max ( instructor.salary )
SQL: SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM instructor WHERE salary  <  (SELECT max(salary) FROM instructor)

Q: "Find the names of students who have taken any course in the fall semester of year 2003."

The SQL query for the sub-question "Find the students who have taken any course in the fall semester of year 2003." is SELECT id FROM takes WHERE semester  =  'Fall' AND YEAR  =  2003
So, the answer to the question "Find the names of students who have taken any course in the fall semester of year 2003." is =
Intermediate_representation: select student.name from student  where  takes.semester = \"Fall\"  and  takes.year = 2003
SQL: SELECT name FROM student WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM takes WHERE semester  =  'Fall' AND YEAR  =  2003)

Q: "Find the minimum salary for the departments whose average salary is above the average payment of all instructors."
Schema_links: [instructor.salary,instructor.dept_name]
A: Let's think step by step. "Find the minimum salary for the departments whose average salary is above the average payment of all instructors." can be solved by knowing the answer to the following sub-question "What is the average payment of all instructors.".
The SQL query for the sub-question "What is the average payment of all instructors." is SELECT avg(salary) FROM instructor
So, the answer to the question "Find the minimum salary for the departments whose average salary is above the average payment of all instructors." is =
Intermediate_representation: select min(instructor.salary) , instructor.dept_name from instructor  where  avg ( instructor.salary )  > avg ( instructor.salary )   group by instructor.dept_name
SQL: SELECT min(salary) ,  dept_name FROM instructor GROUP BY dept_name HAVING avg(salary)  >  (SELECT avg(salary) FROM instructor)

Q: "What is the course title of the prerequisite of course Mobile Computing?"
Schema_links: [course.title,course.course_id = prereq.course_id,prereq.prereq_id,course.title,Mobile Computing]
A: Let's think step by step. "What is the course title of the prerequisite of course Mobile Computing?" can be solved by knowing the answer to the following sub-question "What are the ids of the prerequisite of course Mobile Computing?".
The SQL query for the sub-question "What are the ids of the prerequisite of course Mobile Computing?" is SSELECT T1.prereq_id FROM prereq AS T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN course AS T2 ON T1.course_id  =  T2.course_id WHERE T2.title  =  'Mobile Computing'
So, the answer to the question "What is the course title of the prerequisite of course Mobile Computing?" is =
Intermediate_representation: select course.title from course  where  @.@ in prereq.*  and  course.title = \"Mobile Computing\"
SQL: SELECT title FROM course WHERE course_id IN (SELECT T1.prereq_id FROM prereq AS T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN course AS T2 ON T1.course_id  =  T2.course_id WHERE T2.title  =  'Mobile Computing')

Q: "Give the title and credits for the course that is taught in the classroom with the greatest capacity."
Schema_links: [classroom.capacity,classroom.building = SECTION.building,classroom.room_number = SECTION.room_number,course.title,course.credits,course.course_id = SECTION.course_id]
A: Let's think step by step. "Give the title and credits for the course that is taught in the classroom with the greatest capacity." can be solved by knowing the answer to the following sub-question "What is the capacity of the largest room?".
The SQL query for the sub-question "What is the capacity of the largest room?" is (SELECT max(capacity) FROM classroom)
So, the answer to the question "Give the title and credits for the course that is taught in the classroom with the greatest capacity." is =
Intermediate_representation: select course.title , course.credits from classroom  order by classroom.capacity desc limit 1"
SQL: SELECT T3.title ,  T3.credits FROM classroom AS T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN SECTION AS T2 ON T1.building  =  T2.building AND T1.room_number  =  T2.room_number LEFT OUTER JOIN course AS T3 ON T2.course_id  =  T3.course_id WHERE T1.capacity  =  (SELECT max(capacity) FROM classroom)
